# Motion Planning Algorithms for Non Holonomic Robots using ROS and Turtlebot

## Overview
This repository implements different motion planning algorithms for non holonomic robots using ROS. All the algorithms are tested using turtlebot in Gazebo. 

## Non Holonomic Robot

In the previous project, holonomic robot behaviour was implemented wherein the robot could move sideways. The vehicles (cars, mobile robots etc) are modelled as non-holonomic robots where a neighbour coordinate along a trajectory given the position and orientation is expressed as - 

$$ dx = (radius/2.0)*(u_L+u_R)*\cos(\theta)*dt $$
<!-- $$ dx = (radius/2.0)*(u_L+u_R)*\sin(\theta_(initial))*dt $$
$$ \theta_(initial) += (radius/L)*(u_R-u_L)*dt $$ -->
