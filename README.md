# Motion_planning_of_Robots

## Overview
This repository implements different motion planning algorithms like A*, Dijkrta, BFS, RRT, PRM in a 2D environment for a point robot. All the algorithms are implemented in python. The environment is implemented using a priority queue and is made effecient using the concept of OOPs
